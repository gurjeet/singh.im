This site holds the following sub-domains (in order of creation):

<br>
<a href="http://gurjeet.singh.im">gurjeet</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sggs.singh.im">Sri Guru Granth Sahib</a>
<br>
<a href="http://harmanpreet.singh.im">harmanpreet</a>

<br>
<br>
If your last name is Singh, you can request a subdomain here by simply requesting <a href="mailto:singh.gurjeet@gmail.com?Subject=Request for a singh.im subdomain">me</a>.
<br>
Do understand that you will have to host your own server, I can provide just the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_record#A">A</a> record in my DNS file.
<br>
<br>
Some day I plan to provide email-ids as your-name@singh.im, but that involves a lot of work and infrastructure, so not now :) Example: gurjeet@singh.im
